I have a (possibly dumb) question regarding the instalation of the RTX 3060Ti. It has 2 x 8 slots. I have two 8 (6+2) pin cables. I understand that these are fine to use?

You can literally look up the pinout for Corsair Type-4 power supply cables. I own an RM1000i, same pinout as the HX850i, and have made cables for it.

The Nvidia adapter is designed to follow PCI-SIG's PCIe power delivery specification. It has to work with *every* PCIe compliant PSU, and it's assumed that since the spec is 150W, there are some PSUs that it will eventually be used with that can only supply 150W and no more on each 8-pin. That's why it uses 4 8-pins to deliver 600W.

In reality, *most* PSUs nowadays are perfectly capable of supplying 300W over a single 8-pin. Corsair, at the very least, *knows* that their own PSUs can supply 300W over a single 8-pin. Their cable is only meant to be used with their own PSUs, and the connector is keyed so that it won't fit in other PSUS (it's not a standard 8-pin PCIe plug). Therefore, Corsair is completely free to abide by their own specification, not PCI-SIG's, which is why they can go ahead and draw 300W per 8-pin.

A good quality 850W PSU can power a 4090 with 5800x no problem. 5800x peaks around 120W under 100% all core load. 4090 is 600W, not counting transient spikes.

What they do have (and what I think you're looking for) is [RTX Video Enhancement](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5448/~/rtx-video-super-resolution-faq) which upscales video resolution and reduces artifacts. It supports input resolutions from 360p to 1440p and is most useful with a 4K or 1440p monitor. You can enable in Nvidia Control Panel and it works on videos played in Chrome or Edge. It’s also officially supported in VLC but I think you have to download a specific version of VLC to be able to use the upscaling. NCP also has edge enhancement, noise reduction, and deinterlacing that the GPU can apply to videos.

Short answer:

1. Install MSI AfterBurner with RTSS.
2. Set power target to 90.
3. Set GPU clock to a value between +100 and +150 (milage vary between sillicon quality, so you need to test to get it stable)
4. Set memory to a value between +1000 and +1500 (same tests needed as milage varies)
5. Hit apply button.
6. Rinse and repeat step 3 and 4 until you reach a stable OC, save it to a profile, and make it run at startup.

You can watch many videos on how to OC via MSI Afterburner on YT.",Nvidia

I posted a while back asking how yall handled the fear and pressure of owning a 4090.  A lot of you gave me some answers to mull over.

So I decided to just buy one and stop worrying about it as long as I took the best precautions possible.

&#x200B;

Now, I got the Gigabyte 4090 OC, and while it does fit in my case (TUF GT502), the dedicated 12VHPWR cable from my PSU (GF3 Toughpower 1200), needs to bend against the glass to plug in.

This concerned me a bit, but i made sure the plugs are fully plugged in (clicks and all) and the connectors weren't pulled back by the bend.  I tested multiple games and did some Blender renders with the following results according to HWinfo.

&#x200B;

GPU temps never exceeded 62 C.

12VHPWR cable never went lower than 11.885 v

&#x200B;

I am hoping this means everything is in order and that the bend isn't having an adverse affect?

Should I consider maybe trying to vertically mount the card to avoid the bend?  or literally just stop worrying about this and let the fates decide? :P

This concerned me a bit, but i made sure the plugs are fully plugged in (clicks and all) and the connectors weren't pulled back by the bend.  I tested multiple games and did some Blender renders with the following results according to HWinfo.

&#x200B;

GPU temps never exceeded 62 C.

12VHPWR cable never went lower than 11.885 v

&#x200B;

I am hoping this means everything is in order and that the bend isn't having an adverse affect?

Should I consider maybe trying to vertically mount the card to avoid the bend?  or literally just stop worrying about this and let the fates decide? :P

&#x200B;

Anyways, I know most of you are probably fed up about reading this, but I would love to hear your opinions nonetheless because knowledge is power.

I posted a while back asking how yall handled the fear and pressure of owning a 4090.  A lot of you gave me some answers to mull over.

So I decided to just buy one and stop worrying about it as long as I took the best precautions possible.

&#x200B;

Now, I got the Gigabyte 4090 OC, and while it does fit in my case (TUF GT502), the dedicated 12VHPWR cable from my PSU (GF3 Toughpower 1200), needs to bend against the glass to plug in.

This concerned me a bit, but i made sure the plugs are fully plugged in (clicks and all) and the connectors weren't pulled back by the bend.  I tested multiple games and did some Blender renders with the following results according to HWinfo.

&#x200B;

GPU temps never exceeded 62 C.

12VHPWR cable never went lower than 11.885 v

&#x200B;

I am hoping this means everything is in order and that the bend isn't having an adverse affect?

Should I consider maybe trying to vertically mount the card to avoid the bend?  or literally just stop worrying about this and let the fates decide? :P

I posted a while back asking how yall handled the fear and pressure of owning a 4090.  A lot of you gave me some answers to mull over.

So I decided to just buy one and stop worrying about it as long as I took the best precautions possible.

&#x200B;

Now, I got the Gigabyte 4090 OC, and while it does fit in my case (TUF GT502), the dedicated 12VHPWR cable from my PSU (GF3 Toughpower 1200), needs to bend against the glass to plug in.

This concerned me a bit, but i made sure the plugs are fully plugged in (clicks and all) and the connectors weren't pulled back by the bend.  I tested multiple games and did some Blender renders with the following results according to HWinfo.

&#x200B;

GPU temps never exceeded 62 C.

12VHPWR cable never went lower than 11.885 v

&#x200B;

I am hoping this means everything is in order and that the bend isn't having an adverse affect?

Should I consider maybe trying to vertically mount the card to avoid the bend?  or literally just stop worrying about this and let the fates decide? :P

I wouldn't recommend it to be honest, this kind of gap might cause high resistance in the long run, and due to fans vibrations, the gap becomes wider and wider which will cause melting unfortunately.

I posted a while back asking how yall handled the fear and pressure of owning a 4090.  A lot of you gave me some answers to mull over.

So I decided to just buy one and stop worrying about it as long as I took the best precautions possible.

&#x200B;

Now, I got the Gigabyte 4090 OC, and while it does fit in my case (TUF GT502), the dedicated 12VHPWR cable from my PSU (GF3 Toughpower 1200), needs to bend against the glass to plug in.

This concerned me a bit, but i made sure the plugs are fully plugged in (clicks and all) and the connectors weren't pulled back by the bend.  I tested multiple games and did some Blender renders with the following results according to HWinfo.

&#x200B;

GPU temps never exceeded 62 C.

12VHPWR cable never went lower than 11.885 v

&#x200B;

I am hoping this means everything is in order and that the bend isn't having an adverse affect?

Should I consider maybe trying to vertically mount the card to avoid the bend?  or literally just stop worrying about this and let the fates decide? :P

I'd say keep an eye on the market, because the 4090 is still a good buy, if you want to upgrade it I have no doubt that you can sell it and put a little more money over it for a newer gen if they do release it early.  I agree though, can't be without a GPU for the entire year of 2024, so you still put your money on something that's a great landmark in the market, and will be for quite some time going into the years ahead",Nvidia

I posted a while back asking how yall handled the fear and pressure of owning a 4090.  A lot of you gave me some answers to mull over.

So I decided to just buy one and stop worrying about it as long as I took the best precautions possible.

&#x200B;

Now, I got the Gigabyte 4090 OC, and while it does fit in my case (TUF GT502), the dedicated 12VHPWR cable from my PSU (GF3 Toughpower 1200), needs to bend against the glass to plug in.

This concerned me a bit, but i made sure the plugs are fully plugged in (clicks and all) and the connectors weren't pulled back by the bend.  I tested multiple games and did some Blender renders with the following results according to HWinfo.

&#x200B;

GPU temps never exceeded 62 C.

12VHPWR cable never went lower than 11.885 v

&#x200B;

I am hoping this means everything is in order and that the bend isn't having an adverse affect?

Should I consider maybe trying to vertically mount the card to avoid the bend?  or literally just stop worrying about this and let the fates decide? :P

I posted a while back asking how yall handled the fear and pressure of owning a 4090.  A lot of you gave me some answers to mull over.

So I decided to just buy one and stop worrying about it as long as I took the best precautions possible.

&#x200B;

Now, I got the Gigabyte 4090 OC, and while it does fit in my case (TUF GT502), the dedicated 12VHPWR cable from my PSU (GF3 Toughpower 1200), needs to bend against the glass to plug in.

This concerned me a bit, but i made sure the plugs are fully plugged in (clicks and all) and the connectors weren't pulled back by the bend.  I tested multiple games and did some Blender renders with the following results according to HWinfo.

&#x200B;

GPU temps never exceeded 62 C.

12VHPWR cable never went lower than 11.885 v

&#x200B;

I am hoping this means everything is in order and that the bend isn't having an adverse affect?

Should I consider maybe trying to vertically mount the card to avoid the bend?  or literally just stop worrying about this and let the fates decide? :P

You don’t want to have gaps. The best cable you can use is from Corsair. At least there is a lot of positive feedback. Same for fasgear cable (all 16 pin to 16 pin).",Nvidia

186,16c8w34,1694069834.0,"So, after reading your advice, I decided to bite the proverbial bullet and buy a 4090.","Hello all!

I posted a while back asking how yall handled the fear and pressure of owning a 4090.  A lot of you gave me some answers to mull over.

So I decided to just buy one and stop worrying about it as long as I took the best precautions possible.

&#x200B;

Now, I got the Gigabyte 4090 OC, and while it does fit in my case (TUF GT502), the dedicated 12VHPWR cable from my PSU (GF3 Toughpower 1200), needs to bend against the glass to plug in.

This concerned me a bit, but i made sure the plugs are fully plugged in (clicks and all) and the connectors weren't pulled back by the bend.  I tested multiple games and did some Blender renders with the following results according to HWinfo.

&#x200B;

GPU temps never exceeded 62 C.

12VHPWR cable never went lower than 11.885 v

&#x200B;

I am hoping this means everything is in order and that the bend isn't having an adverse affect?

Should I consider maybe trying to vertically mount the card to avoid the bend?  or literally just stop worrying about this and let the fates decide? :P

&#x200B;

Anyways, I know most of you are probably fed up about reading this, but I would love to hear your opinions nonetheless because knowledge is power.

Thank you for reading, have a great day everyone.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT: I attached some images of the cable and the bend.\*

Yes, it's louder than my FE (both in the same computer) but it doesn't run unusually hot. It's even undervolted and downclocked from factory because of the cooling method. I'd be surprised if 3080 got warmer.

I've seen waterblocks for Gigabyte 3090 Turbo on eBay but those are bespoke. Idk if they're still available. The last I saw one was about 3-4mo ago and it was not cheap. You could probably DIY one if it's large enough to make contact with the memory modules on both sides along with the GPU die. I'm not 100% sure on that, but I would think a 3090 Turbo block might fit a 3080 Turbo PCB. 3080 has less memory modules though, so might be a problem there.

Edit:

>I have it in a CoolerMaster NR200 case

I know NR200 is a really good sff case, but that might be contributing to it? Blowers more sensitive to the case air temps than open air cards.

I would like to actually try water cooling my turbo just to try it out, but the main reason I got it was because of the blower style cooler and two slot design lol",Nvidia

I don't do rendering but I use my GPUs for deep learning training, and those can take hours to days, although the ones that take longer, I use the research lab for that. Pretty much the same level of workload on the GPU I'd imagine. So yeah lol I fully get you, that'd be annoying.

I've also been wanting to downsize to SFF, I got a case which didn't really fit my needs and looking at another that would hopefully work. Then leaving the current big rig at home while using the smaller one when I need to go places, remote desktop to the bigger one as needed.

Until you get it liquid cooled, have you tried undervolting it *more* than the factory undervolt? Or even lowering the thermal limit so the fan doesn't ramp up as much? I did that with my FE and now my fans rarely have to get above 30% when training. Haven't tried with the Turbo but I could give it a shot when I get back home and see if it could be possible solution. Although I understand you probably want to just switch to liquid and being done with the current fan lol

>I did find a brand that sells GPU AIO compatible with this specific model. It's called AlphaCool. Have you ever heard of them or do you have any experience with the brand?

Yeah I've heard of them. I've never used them personally, but I've only heard really good things about them. Just from that, I'd expect it to work perfectly. I'd actually be interested in trying that, because I'm planning on getting *another* blower style 3090 for a SFF computer. I've always preferred air, but I told myself if did a SFF build, I'd be using liquid for that.

If you don't mind, how would you set up the custom loop with respect to the NR200? Would you have space for DIY tubes, pump, and radiator? I'm sure the radiator placement wouldn't be an issue but I can't really picture the tubing because SFF cases tend to not have much free room on the inside, but NR200 isn't really super small case, like some of the ones in the SFFC subreddit. Would you use hard tubes or soft (if you've thought about it yet). If you go through with it, I'd love it if you could post some pics of putting it together, or even just things like tubes used and lengths? Of course you don't have to. It's not rocket science but a little guidance can be very helpful! :)",Nvidia

As far as placement goes, I'm not exactly sure. The GPU with the block would be in the horizontal position as it is now. The major problem right now with the cooler I found is the 360mm radiator which is not compatible with the NR200. I have seen that they have a 240mm variant and I'm in the process of finding out if  I can get the 240mm kit.

The radiator itself would be mounted on the side panel/bracket of the NR200. If the CPU radiator proves to be a problem ( since it's full size NH-D12L I expect it most definitely will be), I will mount the radiator up top. I can 3D print some standoffs and raise the upper panel for a couple of cm to get enough clearance for the radiator and the fans.

The kit provides flexible tubing which can be extended with additional tubing (I have no idea what the system of tubing is called) so I can theoretically place it anywhere without the tubing being a factor. And since I don't care what the insides look like I don't mind if they run straight in the middle of the case.

Hopefully, I remember to post pics when I'm done",Nvidia

The DF team discusses Remedies POV - not NVIDIAs. The new Ray reconstruction denoiser is a software / driver level feature designed and provide by NVIDIA - the developers are responsible for integrating this into their Pipeline.

So, purely speaking from the technical perspective, the technology used here can be deployed in all RTX scenarios. And it seems to be a perfect solution for vastly complex path traced solutions - but since it replaces many different ""RTX software implementations"", the engine needs to be aware of this and hand off certain assets and data on specific points inside the pipeline. 

So ofc, nvidias new ml-based denoiser model can be used for anything ray traced (or path traced, it's the same _really_ - just varying levels of scope).

Yes, gains will be greatest with more RT effect... but still have gains with less RT effects?

> Does DLSS Ray Reconstruction improve performance or take away performance? ...

> Performance varies based on the number of ray-traced effects. Games with multiple ray-traced effects may have several denoisers that are replaced by the single Ray Reconstruction neural network. In these cases, Ray Reconstruction can also offer a performance boost. In titles with less intensive ray tracing and fewer denoisers, Ray Reconstruction improves image quality though may have a slight performance cost.

You may have „confirmed“ that. I know people that reach lower voltages. In fact, you can probably find some videos on YouTube yourself.

So you are the victim of a logical fallacy. You found a subset of people that can only reach a certain voltage, and now assume that that means all cards only reach that voltage.

It’s really not a weird upgrade path at all, it just fits my specific needs. 

> For one, you didn't really to upgrade the cpu

Like I said in my previous comment, I was leaving 20% GPU performance on the table in some titles when I paired my 4090 with my old 5900x. That certainly calls for upgrading the CPU. If I spend almost $2,000 for a 4090 then I don’t want to be CPU bound even at 4K.

> if you were set in upgrading, why not just go for the 5800x3d instead of also replacing ram and mobo

Not to sound arrogant, truly, but if I already went all-out on a 4090 then why do you think I want to remain on last gen AM4 with a 5800x3D? I want the best performance to compliment a 4090, therefore I switched to the latest and greatest platform. Not everyone is doing a budget build or analyzing performance-per-dollar. 

>  And lastly, if you were really set on am5, why not get a 7800x3d?

Far as the 7800x3D is concerned, it has less cores and less V-cache than the 7900x3D. **“B-but tech-bro YouTubers say 7800x3D best gaming CPU!”** - sure … but I don’t *JUST* do pure gaming. I stream, photo edit,  and do 3D rendering work on the side as a hobby, so I’m not going from 12 cores back down to 8.  My PC is used for both light production work and gaming, and the 7900x3D is the perfect dual-purpose CPU for me. Besides, I game at 4K so the real-world performance loss of going with the 7900x3D instead of the 7800x3D is around -5%, nothing major.",Nvidia

As far as I know I should be fine even with a 4090, but I was wondering if with a dual (vs a triple) I need to be worried about heat or transient spikes? 

I intend to set a power limit anyway, and do not intend to overclock anything.

Thank you!",4,tattoosandturntables,"Depending on your use case, you could get away with using a 750w. I wouldnt suggest it since you would be maxing your PSU out, but I'm sure you've seen LTTs video on the subject.

Thank you!",4,tattoosandturntables,"The 2x8 in itself is not a problem at all as long as the cable is designed like this (that means you do not use the 12VHPWR ==> 3x8 conversion and plug in only 2x8), many 3rd party cables from PSU manufacturers are only 2x8 ==> 16pin 12VHPWR, and this is fine even for 4090. 
The only question that remains then is the wattage of the PSU, 750W should be fine even for 4090 as long as you stay at the default 450W limit and do not OC using higher power limit.
You can test it and see, in any case you can always undervolt and lower the consmuption by some 100-150W, which should fix any power related problems you might have.",Nvidia

Hi all

I had a problem with my hard drive so I took it to my local PC repair shop. Getting that issue sorted but he did tell me that my graphics card is an engineering sample. Said it’s very rare these make it out of the factory and sometimes when they do, they can be sold on eBay. He said they can either be better performing than a retail model or they can have issues. He ran some tests and said it’s in good health, performing well and there’s no concerns. 

I got my PC from a shop here in the UK which make custom PCs (well known and highly regarded). 

I’m just wondering can anyone fill me in on engineering samples and should I be concerned enough to go back to shop about it. I got my PC in Jan 2022, at a time of high prices and shortages. I don’t know if it’s worth going back to them or if it’s really nothing to worry about as it’s in good health and performing well.

Hi all

I had a problem with my hard drive so I took it to my local PC repair shop. Getting that issue sorted but he did tell me that my graphics card is an engineering sample. Said it’s very rare these make it out of the factory and sometimes when they do, they can be sold on eBay. He said they can either be better performing than a retail model or they can have issues. He ran some tests and said it’s in good health, performing well and there’s no concerns.

402,16bsdq1,1694026080.0,Quadro K600 performance?,"(First post, don't harass me pls)

Hello, I have not so much money and I've bought used Quadro K600 for rendering some scenes. I have RTX 2070 and it's bad for me at previews in programs like AE (even on 0.25x). I've googled and not found any good benchmarks or smth about it, everything is just ""gaming"" and comparing to RTX graphics cards.
 
I know that K600 is kinda poor choice, it has no driver support and around 200 CUDA cores, but I just needed to find a way to render something faster.
Also, I searched yt and results are...ok? idk

If it weren't for DLSS, the 2070 would have been obsolete a while back (For certain AAA games). It allowed me still to be able to play almost all AAA games at maxed-out settings, with 60+ fps at 1080p. Once you throw high raytracing or go above that 1080p though... 

I'm still gaming at 1080p until I can next upgrade my monitor setup. I do have a 144hz monitor, the 4070 ti easily hits 144 FPS in everything. I felt like frame-gen was magic. The 2070 was/is still amazing. I just missed out on the 3000 series and really wanted to upgrade so that when I get/go 2k I can have decent FPS.

I run two 27” 1440p @164. On my 2080s I was able to play almost anything at maxed settings minus Witcher3, Cyberpunk, Metro Exodus. I Love this card. This is my first time having a current gen card. Normally I upgrade to previous gens once the price basically bottoms out.

My own benchmarks (everything is at 1440p)

Cyberpunk 
2080s almost maxed settings (75-77fps) 
4070TI OC maxed Physco Settings (124-126fps)

BG3 (maxed settings)
2080S Maxed settings (80-89fps)
4070TI OC Maxed settings (152-164fps)

SnowRunner (maxed settings)
2080S (70-75fps)
4070ti OC (96-110fps)

American Truck Sim (Maxed settings, tons of graphic mods)
2080S (80-100fps)
4070ti OC (155-164+fps)

Metro Exodus
2080S almost all maxed settings (85-95fps)
4070ti OC Maxed settings (151-164+fps)

RDR2 Maxed settings
2080S (70-90fps)
4070ti OC (121-140fps)

Witcher 3 Maxed Settings
2080S (90-100fps)
4070ti OC (164+FPS)


I kept going back and forth between the 4070ti OC and 4080, money isn’t an issue for me. Ultimately the 4070ti OC was a much better performance per dollar for my 1440p gaming. Plus it’s very quiet and does not go over 60c under full load. Also!! No coil whine! My 2080S has loud coil whine and under full load it hovers around 80-85c.

When the intersection happens and 2x performance drops below your price, you buy.

You can set this up any way you like for any kind of improvement and price.

However, you should also consider the rest of your system and in particular your monitors refresh rate and resolution.

As for the poor optimization, a lot of the newer games have begun to assume there's some kind of upscaling technology available. This means they are able to crank up a good deal of computational budget, mostly to get more accurate light. Some of it is dropping the optimization on the floor, but not all. It's likely a conscious decision in many cases, where you want to cut into your development effort which means you have to compute more stuff when the game is running. General rule: they want the current generation of consoles to be able to hit 30fps, and upscaling tech is helping them achieve this with a much higher computational budget shoved into scene quality.",Nvidia

I really wanted to upgrade to the 4090, but it's just too expensive, and DLSS kind of saved me for the last couple of years. Maybe AMD's Frame Generation will give me a little more time, but I don't think so.

I am leaning more towards the 7900XTX as the price is much more manageable, but I haven't pulled the trigger yet.

Being in my 30s with a family does not leave a lot of time to play (I'm dying to go back to Starfield, hahaha), so I can wait a little longer when my little one is bigger and might give him my PC and get myself a new one, but that is at least 2 years away.",Nvidia

Same gpu I started using SD with, 6gb seemed enough for the 512x512 image generations. I ran into out of memory error once I got more into it. 

Then went with a 2080super, good performance and about the same power consumption of the 2060. Ran out of vram soon enough in SD.

Upgrade to a 2080ti, great performance for SD, and also a very good undervolting gpu. Almost matches a 3080 stable diffusion performance at only 160w undervolted. I'm at the point where I'm running out of vram again.

The 4080 16gb is the only upgrade I need, but I'm not willing to spend that amount for the performance it has.

I'm going with another 2080ti in nvlink, because it exceeds the performance of a 4080. nvlink is great for machine learning, double your vram capacity.

The used market is great, I'm not buying 4000 series until it has better price/performance. I'd go with AMD if they can get their SD working in windows.

There's really no point in going 12gb for future proofing, and we are already half way through the gpu gen cycle. Let's nope next gen won't be a bust like this gpu gen. I'll be shocked if they offer the same price/performance as last gen. Which mean the GPU market will be stagnant for 6 years in terms of price/performance.

Still the used gpu market is great, can even find 4000 series used at better prices, but it still not great.",Nvidia

>You're never going to ""Future proof""...

Can you tell me about your gaming experience with the 2070 ?

All those big numbers is overwhelming for me since I'm fairly new to RTX gaming. I'm still using an old laptop with GTX 1050-Ti.

I really want to get the most out of it. So I did some research on the optimal settings (Nvidia and Ingame settings). 
The final result is mind blowing. I can't believe I able to play triple-A games on 1080p with a mixed of ultra/low settings. 

 Starfield was my latest breakthrough. I'm willing to share my finding here.

Are you hoping the 50xx series will be the golden ticket, or going to use that to get a 40xx card?",232,ThomasTiltTrain,"As far as my experience with the 2070, it was amazing. I could play pretty much every game maxed out/ultra at 60-60+ (Going to 80-100 in some games) FPS (Even new AAA titles) EXCEPT for ray-tracing (Where I had to settle for medium-low if that). This at 1080p is expected, and decent. DLAA/DLSS helps a lot. Stutter was more of an issue at times than FPS. The majority of the time, the stutter is not the GPU, but I also am running an i7-12700k, NVMe drives, etc.

As far as your videos. The first video (Starfield) would be completely unplayable for me. It looks like you are getting 15 FPS at times (I've been there, and have played at that) - but that is fine if it is fine for you (Although that game JUST released, and I am sure has a lot of bugs that contribute as well). Cyberpunk, 30 FPS is not so appealing to me, but isn't bad nor unobtainable even on a GTX 970, same with Red-dead. 

You can optimize any game to not only run but there are even mods to make the quality of games ""worse"" so that they can run on old hardware - that is part of the beauty of PC gaming (I've done this in the past). 

On a lot of games, you can get good-looking graphics (Especially at 1080p) for not much GPU or CPU performance. Graphics your family, non-tech friends, etc. wouldn't be able to tell anyway the difference VS you (It would still blow them away).

You mention a ""Mix of ultra-low settings"" It REALLY matters what those settings are... One setting on ultra can have virtually no effect versus another on even medium (Shadows, anti-aliasing, lighting, etc. being big offenders). But, again, that is the beauty of PC gaming. You can fine-tune, and choose what quality you don't really care for that sweet FPS gain.

Playing with EVERYTHING on Ultra + Raytracing, and above 1080p? That is another story, and what I would like to be able to do with this GPU I have now.

I had mentioned in another comment ""Even though most games look good even on medium... It's a vice like most others, I guess. To want to play at absurd settings that you probably wouldn't even notice if it was changed without you knowing. lol.""",Nvidia

All those big numbers is overwhelming for me since I'm fairly new to RTX gaming. I'm still using an old laptop with GTX 1050-Ti.

I really want to get the most out of it. So I did some research on the optimal settings (Nvidia and Ingame settings). 

The final result is mind blowing. I can't believe I able to play triple-A games on 1080p with a mixed of ultra/low settings. 

 Starfield was my latest breakthrough. I'm willing to share my finding here.

It’s just that Starfield in particular is very heavy on the CPU so a bottleneck there will be more pronounced. It’s why FG is so effective for increasing frame rate in that title.

4K 240Hz is definitely too heavy on modern AAA games even for a 4090. Personally, I think 1440p 165Hz is the sweet spot.

Thanks and YES! How did you figured it out? 😱

I was following this advice.
""Even if it isn’t a high frame rate such as 120 FPS or even 60 FPS, having an FPS limiter set at 30 FPS when your GPU fluctuates between 25 and 40 can give you a console level of stability and help you forget you ever had FPS issues.

Another positive side effect of an FPS limiter tool is that, because fewer frames are required, the GPU will logically produce fewer frames and therefore require less power. Less power means lower temperatures which leads to a quieter PC.""

Disabling autosaves helps a bit (seems to happen on autosaves) but I don't think it prevents all autosaving. Tried the common tweaks such as enabling an FPS cap through reflex.

I'm also getting audio stutter/static at times which only happens in this game. It's installed on an NVMe SSD (same partition as Windows) so I don't think that's an issue.

Running 4K / ultra everything gives me 120+ frames with Preset D and frame generation. This is on a 4090 / 13900K, 64GB RAM.

Edit: I ended up subscribing to PureDark’s version which came out with its beta6 a little earlier. It has some features to help crashing which addressed my situation. Sound still stuttering though which is prob a game issue thing.",Nvidia

I believe that games that don't have DLSS will either have FSR/XeSS as an alternative, even if inferior, or perhaps isn't demanding enough that you could play 4K native on a 4070. Finally if it really comes down to it, there's also NIS to try out that works at a driver level.

In Starfield with DLSS and frame gen at 1440p I'm getting about 125fps outside, 150 indoors, and 105 in New Atlantis.

Ideally I wouldn’t want to upgrade for about 3-5 years after this one.",83,fifa-13-Esswein,"If it's a question about 7900 XTX versus the 4080, what kind of games do you play? Better still, what you have played in the past year? Have you enabled raytracing on them? Do you see yourself jumping to 4K?

If it's just straight rasterization, the 7900 XTX beats the 4080 in a bunch of benchmarks. Of course, things go to hell with RT enabled.

The other question is how often do you use upscaling tech? DLSS has all the features now. FSR 3 is going to be a slow rollout. So if you want Frame Gen, you get it now with the 4080. Also, if you are into VR, I hear AMD's cards are lacking (no hands on experience though)

It's not an easy question. Personally, I'm in the same boat. I have a 3070 and looking to update now. I've settled on the 4080 especially now that it's 1,100 from NewEgg. 

I would have loved the 4070 TI, but we are seeing 1440p games exceed 10 gigs and according to DF, even 12 gigs (with raytracing) so I'm jumping a tier. For me the price difference is close enough between AMD and nVidia that I'm staying in Team Green although I'd like to see AMD succeed.

Here in Spain , the day the 4090 I was able to come back from work, calmly open the page where I usually like to buy my hardware.

Had 6 different models in stock to choose from.
I had time to read specs (specially sizes) of each model.

Did some research in google to help me decide which partner card  to choose (I don’t like the Fe models)
Came back to the page , chose it and bought it.
No hassle at all.

5 days later my best friend came to my house , tried gaming on my pc , loved it and decided to upgrade his 3080 10gb to a 4090 too.
 
I sent him a link to the same page , and he also had 6-7 4090 models in stock, and chose the one he liked the most too.

No problem either.

So I don’t see that they where “controlling the stock” at least not here.


Disclaimer: unlike the US and Canada , the 4090 launched for 1950€ here in Spain

That alone reduces the amount of buyers",Nvidia

These sorts of ""PCB rulers"" are common giveaways for companies that design PCBs and it's something of a jr. engineer task to design your own in order to get familiar w/ an ECAD platform.  Ostensibly you can use them to compare footprints to figure out component size and footprint patterns but honestly... anyone that would use this probably already can eyeball most of that but it can be handy if you're trying to figure out is a part is SOT23 or SOT323 etc.

The Gaming Trio has a plastic cooler shroud when there shouldn't be plastic like that on an enthusiast card like a 4090. It still looks good but it feels cheaper and plasticky. 

The Gaming Trio is one of the only 4090s that doesn't use a vapor chamber. I've had both cards and the FE had better thermals than the Gaming Trio. Keep in mind this was only my own experience though. My case can only fit a GPU up to 340mm in length, so the Gaming Trio may have just cut off top-bottom and bottom-top airflow in my case. The FE is a far better fit and allows more airflow, hence a possible factor for better thermals. You may not notice a difference with a larger case though.",Nvidia

I can still afford it but barely and I might have to get a cheaper cpu cooler (cpu cooler died so need new). 

The founders edition 4090 is currently in stock for £1519 and i dont know whether i should get that instead? 

Is the founders edition a good model? 

Is the msi model worth the extra £130? 

Does the founders edition have worse cooling  performance, coil whine etc?

Would I run into any problems with the FE i wouldn't have with the msi?

Yes, marketing. 

I'm writing this comment from my phone that has 3088x1440 at 6,8"". That's 500ppi. I'd guess it's pretty high. 
However I definitively wouldn't trade it for being forced to lower in game details. 1440p at 27"" has great ppi and the only case where it could not be enough would be professional graphics and designing. For gaming 4K at such screen size would be dumb. If you want to play at 4K just get a real 4K screen like a 65"" OLED TV at put it next to your desk. There it makes sense.

I got an RTX 3060 to dip my toes back in nvidia and see what’s up. I stopped having random issues. Literally things just worked again, even old games I thought I’d never play again.

This is why I can’t take AMD seriously anymore. If I want to build a computer for my wife or my grandma or someone who doesn’t know how to fiddle with the thing just to get it to work, I would sure as hell not give them a Radeon GPU.

Like you I tried multiple times, but it's over for good

3DFX was better and without issues, Radeons was crap

Nvidia bought 3DFX and continued without issues, AMD bought Radeon and yeah... we know what..

I'm not a fanboy, I just don't like headaches

Just taking a quick recent example : 
- looking at my TV thread (65QN95B), you can see AMD users  having a very bad time toggling HDR on PC, as the TV stays in BT709, aka doesn't swith to HDR gamut. Dozen of posts in the threads, but there is a driver tricky tip to fix it (headache)
- you have a meter and want to calibrate your TV ? just take madTPG generator (madVR) and switch it to HDR for HDR patterns, but yeah that doesn't work with AMD cards. Forget about calibrating easily your TV (headache)

You'll litteraly always have garbage non working use cases with Radeon GPU (just like when it wasn't branded AMD; I remember, I couldn't use my Tv card 20 years ago once I switched Radeon)

After having gone through random but frequent crashes led by notorious AMD driver timeout issues and countless attempts to fix the issues with the fixes the internet people provided but all in vain, I finally gave up and asked if I could return it after nearly 2 months. Luckily, my long history of membership with Amazon paid off and they accepted my return after telling me the fact that the return window had expired and usually they wouldn't honor such a request. But again, I am thankful to Amazon and bought a brand new 4090 RTX from eBay for roughly the same price of $1300 bucks.  There has not been a single crash since I switched the card to 4090 RTX. I mostly play COD Modern Warfare 2 and ever since it's been like that.

I'm with you, I had a 6700 XT for over two years as an upgrade from my 1070 and it was great until mid 2022 where a driver update basically broke the hardware video accelerator that they've just been bandaging ever since. If I wanted to play a game and watch a video at the same time or run wallpaper engine simultaneously, be prepared for an inevitable black screen.

When they introduced the DXNavi library to improve OpenGL and DX11 performance, it did improve performance for a lot of games but made some games become a stutters unplayable mess so I had to disable it via regedit.

I've never had issues with hardware video acceleration or needed to chop up my registry to increase driver stability with Nvidia cards. Their cards are absolutely overpriced but I just couldn't tolerate my 6700 XT anymore and got a 4080 instead.",Nvidia

This is why I avoid Asus for their AMD GPUs because every single one I own from them always has that issue, and trust me, guys, I know for sure you'd avoid a GPU that would idle at 55°c and full load at 90°c with the fans moving at 100%.

I wanted to like the 7900XTX but after seeing in-depth reviews about the insane idle power draw and high draw in medium power stages I got the 4090. Couldn't be happier.

I honestly have never had a more hands on experience with a card having the change settings and turn stuff off and on just to get stability. The last 2 drivers that brought Starfield to the table were the last straw. 

Only then I realized the replacement card I had been using had the wrong serial. This comes after Asus had been doing dodgy shit with AMD boards and other such RMA things. So to find out when they said ""we replaced heatsink and fans"" that the serial on the card was for another country. I noped out of it.

Told my reseller, your taking the card back. I no longer feel comfortable using a card with the wrong serial and as buggy as it is I can't get it warranted because the serials don't match!

After working hard and spending big money on an expensive GPU, people just want it to *work.* They want products that are less likely to have problems and have fewer limitations to worry about.

But, real talk, when it comes to GPUs, Nvidia's tech is doing everything, EVERYTHING, better than AMD's. You can give AMD an edge in power consumption, but for desktop products nobody really cares about that. 

AMD is the underdog in this segment and I know they can catch up, but they have a long way to go and a lot of work to do. And in the meantime, we consumers are stuck in the middle, either settling for worse rasterization performance, no CUDA, and compatibility issues, or paying an absurd premium to go team green.

And meanwhile both companies have dollar signs in their eyes thanks to AI.

The Grass is LITERALLY GREENER on this side.",326,Coyote_Complete,"I spent more on my Asus X670E mobo than I did on the 7950X and I’ve only had great experiences this far. It’ll be a year this month that I upgraded to AM5 using ASUS X670E Hero, and the 7950X and I’m very glad I spent the extra to get all the features I wanted/needed on the motherboard.

I also bought the Asus TUF OC 4090 on launch morning and have had no issues with it either. Actually, both Asus products have far exceeded my high expectations. Knock on wood, but they have legit been the best motherboard and GPU I’ve used and have not had any issues. I’d buy them both again today, even after all the Asus news.

Asus was in the news because their beta bios stated that it was not covered in warranty when X3D CPUs were being fried by the SOC voltages. But Asus ended up stating that all bios versions are covered in warranty and they changed the wording. And the X3D CPUs being fried were happening no matter which motherboard brand you had bought. Again, even if it happened, they were covered in warranty.

Also Asus seems to be hit and miss when it comes to RMA. But that’s legit every company out there. I’m not an Asus fan but I’m also not against them. So far I’ve only had good experiences with their high end parts. I have also helped around a dozen people build PCs this past year and over half of them use Asus AM5 motherboards and 40 series GPUs. Only one has had issues but he’s not even sure what the cause may be, but he thinks it’s something to do with his Asus X670E Extreme. But like I said, he’s not sure what the problem is other than he has to turn his pc on a certain way or he gets random reboots.

With all parts, do your research and see which is best for that exact part and is in your budget, and buy that one. I will vouch and say that the X670E Hero, while expensive, is by far the best motherboard I’ve ever used. Same with my Asus TUF OC 4090.",Nvidia

The pricing is ridiculous for both manufacturers and anyone who is capable of independent thought can see that they're clearly working together.

Especially when the inferior product is so much less efficient that it actually becomes more expensive in total cost of ownership. Speaking specifically about the 4080 vs XTX here, the extra VRAM would be nice, but it's not necessary, nor worth paying more for, while also losing out on the countless benefits that come with an Nvidia GPU that you don't get on AMD.

AMD has a horrible track record of over promising and under delivering. That's why I don't believe for a second that FSR3 will be able to compete with DLSS3 or 3.5. Their track record just screams ""bullshit"" on themselves.",Nvidia

ASUS puts more budget into their branding and marketing than into their build quality and quality control at this point. You still have some lemmings here that will parrot ""ROG best"" but fortunately that number is dwindling down to the most hardcore fanboys.

For sure, Nvidia has better software than AMD, but AMD cards are cheaper and age better (due to higher VRAM and more raster power) than their Nvidia equivalents which IMO more than makes up for it.

AMD's SAM, for some reason, do not have the same ""VRAM increasing"" effect. as a result, AMD can let it be used freely. 

I have no idea why rebar increases the vram consumption.

first, I figured it was because the card is utilizing VRAM more efficiently so game can use more resources.

but then, Cyberpunk became a laggy mess with Rebar on. I noticed that rebar added an additional 750 mb of vram load on my 3070, and that practically killed my framerates. I made similar tests in forza horizon 5 and came to similar results. Rebar causes extra vram load, as a result game stutters more and drops more frames, and sometimes textures refuses to load (where they would load without rebar).",Nvidia

I *suspect* it's because AMD force it on so if devs have a resizable bar specific codepath where they've made a boo boo, like reading from a gpu upload heap, it will get caught when they test on AMD SKUs even if they don't specifically test for performance regressions on enabling the feature. I'm not a game dev mind you so this is just a wild guess.

It is however also pretty rare that I've noticed any measurable performance increases so I don't think it's a massive issue which way round they do it. The status quo is obviously a testing burden on NV though and probably isn't something they want to maintain indefinitely. Sooner or later they'll need to enable it by default moving forward.",Nvidia

Thanks!",21,clipghost,"You did, but you were referring more to dlaa. I wasn’t though (in my first post), and neither was the guide. Regardless the point of my second post is that dlss and dlaa are not always available together (only a few games officially support dlaa; you can use dlsstweaks but ymmv—I was not impressed) and dlaa is not perfect. 

Sure, I use dlaa (Spider-Man, Chorvs) but I don’t blindingly turn it on without comparing it to other options. It’s the best aa but if dlss has ghosting, dlaa will too. Uncharted 4 has ghosting no matter the dlss version (fsr 2 is actually better in that game). I stick with TAA and wouldn’t even consider dlaa there. Forza Horizon 5 has ghosting behind the car (I race in third person mode, you may not see it if you race in first person). Dlaa and dlss is unusable in that game to me.

The only real difference is that the desktop version has faster memory at 17 GBPS vs 16 GBPS for the laptop version, so it will be slightly faster in general due to faster memory and slightly higher boost clocks but you can also easily OC the laptop's VRAM to that level as well. Overall you should expect the desktop chip to be a little faster but with some overlocking to the core and memory you should be able to basically match the desktop chip at least. You will need 100+ watts VBIOS though to get maximum performance out of this chip. On my laptop on BF2042 it can easily use 95+ watts.

Cinema 4D and Redshift.  This is what Maxwell make money from and this is that they have been working on.  


Why does it perform better on apple silicon than older CB?  


Two reasons:  


Firstly memory bandwidth the data-set is larger since anyone doing CPU path tracing these days is not doing it on a tiny scene, the complexity of the scenes in older CB was so trival that most modern chips spend most of the time reading writing to L2/L3 cache and never needed to hit the system memory.  


Secondly the older versions of CB were very fare behind Cinema 4D in thier perfomance on apple silicon, they were in effect the Cinema 4D code base (with all its hand crafted intel optimisations) just compile directly for apple silicon, so did not even use any SIMD operations just plain c for loops when on ARM-64.

I got my 7950x3d for 600 USD from microcenter And this was only 2-3 months after release where the original MSRP was 799 USD. 

I worked at bestbuy for 2 years and experienced 2 black Fridays as a worker. The items that have the biggest sales are accessorie items, that also happens to be where bestbuy makes the biggest margins for profit as well.  Bestbuy would also throw in a 50 or 60 inch TV that's actually pretty shit and from a unknown company, and bestbuy just wants to clear their inventory of the tv. People just see 50 inch HDR 4k tv and an insane sale, so they salivate over it.   Our real products like laptops,consoles, PC hardware, and appliances won't have any big sale at all, the profit margins where already non existent and we relied on warranty sales and accessories to make money. I wouldn't bank on them going on a massive sale on black Friday, and would just keep an eye out constantly for a random sale.",Nvidia

The issue is that the next level up, the 4070 is $200 more. That’s a big jump. At the same time, the 3060 ti is only $50 less ( I think because the 3000 series is pretty loved, they’ve kept a high value). The 3070 is usually $100 more than the 4060 ti and the 3070 still has 8 gigs too.

I’m hoping the 4060 ti will give me 3 more years to be able to play newer games at 1080. By then, my cpu will be old enough that the card won’t be the issue.

* They then decided to amend their contracts to allow other upscalers if the developers wanted it, and then trotted out this answer to show that they're ""the good guys"", while basically throwing all of the developers who have had contracts with them under the bus.

People being mad at him is just missing the point when the devs are the ones everyone should be mad at. 

The way I see it, at this point the more drama around DLSS missing in games the better. If FSR was actually comparable to DLSS or even XeSS, there wouldn't be much drama to begin with, but the fact is we're reminded every game that FSR is just not on the same level.",Nvidia

2296,16ap7hw,1693922725.0,Star Wars: Jedi Survivor new Patch 7 adds DLSS Support,,481,Electrical_Form_7572,"Here's likely what happened:

* AMD had a contractual clause blocking all competitor's features and upcaling in sponsored titles.
* Everyone got wind of this, backlash ensued, and they maintained radio silence for months while they figured out how to handle it. They wouldn't have eaten all of the shitty negative press over this otherwise.
* They then decided to amend their contracts to allow other upscalers if the developers wanted it, and then trotted out this answer to show that they're ""the good guys"", while basically throwing all of the developers who have had contracts with them under the bus.

Frank Azor basically admitted that they were blocking DLSS in an interview:

>Azor, [a co-founder of Alienware](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18744450/alienware-dell-frank-azor-amd-chief-gaming-officer), has had many open conversations with me over the years, and this is the only thing he’s been cagey about all afternoon. AMD specifically prepped for this exact question, he says, because the situation’s a little delicate. “We want to be very careful not to put this answer onto our partners,” says Azor.  
>  
>**He admits that — in general — when AMD pays publishers to bundle their games with a new graphics card, AMD does expect them to prioritize AMD features in return. “Money absolutely exchanges hands,” he says. “When we do bundles, we ask them: ‘Are you willing to prioritize FSR?**’”

[https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/25/22372077/amd-starfield-dlss-fsr-exclusive-frank-azor](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/25/22372077/amd-starfield-dlss-fsr-exclusive-frank-azor)

Basically: ""We, uh...don't outright tell them to **block** DLSS, but we hand them a sizeable sack of cash and **strongly** suggest it.""

Now, we can plainly see that ""prioritizing FSR"" is doublespeak for blocking other upscalers, as that's been the case in over 90% of AMD sponsored titles. It's not as if they're just spending additional time tweaking and streamlining FSR to have the best possible implementation while leaving the other upscalers available to users. That would be fine, and a normal ask of a sponsorship deal.

It's pretty obvious that they're outright blocking upscaling options for users in sponsored titles, and Developers have said as much.

AMD had better hope that Nvidia doesn't turn around and do something similar, as they have the ability to easily bankroll FSR out of existence by ""sponsoring"" every AAA game for the next decade if they were so inclined. I wouldn't condone that either, but they're playing with fire here.",Nvidia

The game’s FSR2 already offered the performance gains you’d get from upscaling, which would be similar to DLSS. But if you didn’t use FSR2 previously and turned on DLSS now then you’d see GPU gains. Unfortunately you’d need a 40 series card to use the Frame Generation part of DLSS which has been added - this helps a lot in CPU bottlenecks, which is where this game has most problems. So, probably nothing major from DLSS but you will see better image quality with it than FSR AND you could therefore go for a more aggressive upscale - which could help.

It’s something Nvidia users have been clocking for a couple years now, but it didn’t really get attention until a [Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/whats-up-with-the-missing-nvidia-dlss-support-in-amd-sponsored-fsr-titles/) article called it out out last June. They pointed out that a majority of AMD sponsored games lacked DLSS support, while a majority of Nvidia games have more than DLSS support. A lot of us were glad someone was finally saying what we’ve been thinking every time a game was revealed to be AMD sponsored. 

They asked Nvidia and AMD about competitor upscalers in their sponsored games. Nvidia unambiguously stated they do not hinder or discourage the use of FSR or Xess in the games they sponsor. AMD said they’re doing what’s best for gamers in giving the flexibility for devs to implement FSR. They didn’t mention whether they block competing upscalers directly, and the statement was ambiguous enough to fuel more speculation. 

Then right as the controversy had cooled down a bit, Bethesda and AMD announced they were exclusive partners for Starfield, one of the most anticipated games of the last few years. This blew up the situation even worse than before, as it was clear that Starfield would be FSR only and probably not include decent Ray tracing. The major techtubers got involved and were asking AMD for a definitive statement whether they were blocking competing upscalers in Starfield specifically. This time they would say “No comment” and stick with that for everyone that asked. 

AMD held firm on their No comment stance until just recently, when Frank Azor from AMD made a statement that if the studio wants to add DLSS, [they have AMDs full support. ](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/25/22372077/amd-starfield-dlss-fsr-exclusive-frank-azor) It didn’t really change the narrative much though, mainly because there was a lingering question about why it took 8 weeks to arrive at that answer when Nvidia gave a satisfactory answer from the get-go. The speculation now is that in that timeframe, AMD revised their contracts to more freely allow DLSS in their sponsored games. It was announced that same day that the Avatar game, which is AMD sponsored, would include both FSR and DLSS. Now with DLSS support coming to Jedi Survivor, it does feel like backlash against AMD changed something behind the scenes.",Nvidia

Spoiled for choice with Baldur's Gate 3, Armored Core 6, and Starfield. When I first started playing Starfield I was lowkey appalled by the performance.

I'm running the game on a 5900x with a 3080Ti with the DLSS patch and a 4K upscale resolution + the render scale adjusted to what would be the equivalent of the DLSS ""quality mode"" preset and I get around 60-70 FPS on the average planet, 80-90 FPS in indoor areas, and the most taxing areas of the game (generally the big cities like New Atlantis) are in the 50-60FPS range. The asset quality is actually quite high. Especially on the weapons and the character faces (when in actual conversation with them).

It could definitely run better, but it's at least playable for me. I've seen higher CPU utilization than just about any other game I've played though (around 80% in the big cities and the game is loading up all 12 cores). If you get the game, I'd also highly recommend getting the mod that allows the UI when you are flying the spaceship to run at 120FPS. 

For some bizarre reason by default the spaceship UI is locked to 30 FPS so it will seem like it is running really badly but it's the UI itself not the game. Removing that 30FPS lock makes piloting the ships far more enjoyable and makes aiming soooo much easier.

>Azor, [a co-founder of Alienware](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18744450/alienware-dell-frank-azor-amd-chief-gaming-officer), has had many open conversations with me over the years, and this is the only thing he’s been cagey about all afternoon.

>**He admits that — in general — when AMD pays publishers to bundle their games with a new graphics card, AMD does expect them to prioritize AMD features in return. “Money absolutely exchanges hands,” he says. “When we do bundles, we ask them: ‘Are you willing to prioritize FSR?**’”

Basically: ""We, uh...don't outright tell them to **block** DLSS, but we hand them a sizeable sack of cash and **strongly** suggest it.""

Now, we can plainly see that ""prioritizing FSR"" is doublespeak for blocking other upscalers, as that's been the case in over 90% of AMD sponsored titles. It's not as if they're just spending additional time tweaking and streamlining FSR to have the best possible implementation while leaving the other upscalers available to users. That would be fine.

It's pretty obvious that they're outright blocking upscaling options for users in sponsored titles, and Developers have said as much.

AMD had better hope that Nvidia doesn't turn around and do something similar, as they have the ability to easily bankroll FSR out of existence by ""sponsoring"" every AAA game for the next decade if they were so inclined. I wouldn't condone that either, but they're playing with fire here.",Nvidia

Agreed. My back log is fricken huge lol. I'm 130 hours into Baldurs Gate 3, so that's been consuming my time, but I have been able to squeeze 13 hours of Armoured Core 6 inbetween.

I still have to finish Cyberpunk 2077, then Phantom Liberty comes out.

And then not to mention Starfield comes out tomorrow on GamePass. Speaking of GamePass I haven't finished Plague Tale 2 or Forza Horizon 5 yet.

Haven't had time to play games like Jedi Survivor or Hogwarts Legacy yet either.

Spiderman 2 is out soon for PS5, speaking of PS5 I need to finish up Final Fantasy 16...

&#x200B;

I only  play the biggest/best games on launch (Elden Ring, God of War Ragnarok, The Last of Us, Baldurs Gate 3, Resident Evil 4 remake) so games like Hogwarts, Star Wars Jedi, Hitman, Starfield etc get pushed out. waiting 7 months is nothing.

Unlikely, they likely state ""prioritise FSR"" or something along those lines and some studios/publishers decided to er on the side of caution and removed DLSS, while others never bothered to implement it either due to laziness or genuinely because they arent allowed.

Its scummy behavior locking people out of tech but its been done by all of the 3 major companies in this industry at some point, clearly its legal in this sense but I would agree its not morally good and harms us long term as consumers which is why people are right to put pressure on AMD to stop it or atleast clarify to partners that its allowed",Nvidia

the same tired arguement. you didnt even read my comment

FSR 2 released may 2022, and wasnt added to CP until november. as you said, its easy to impliment competing upscalers, and yet they waited so long that modders had to take it into their own hands. 

6 months it took them, to add someting that would have been, in your own words, 'incredibly easy to implement'.

where is the outrage for CDPR ignoring the pleas for its addition? where are the accusations of nvidia blocking it? you dont have the same energy for that as you do this. 

to be clear i doubt nvidia had a hand in the delay of FSR 2

sometimes management just prioritises other things, especially if management is disconnected with the gaming community at large and thinks the upscaling checkbox is filled

What? No, I didn't read the headline, I READ THE QUOTES FROM Studio Surgical Scalpels who are THE DEVELOPERS. If they were themselves spreading fake news, then that's not my problem, is it? There was a whole god damn Q&A the devs did with WCCFTech, it's not something WCCFTech came up with.

Quotes below.

Question:

>Boundary originally made headlines for its cutting-edge ray tracing and DLSS support. For the early access launch, which ray-traced effects are you going to include in the game?

Answer from the dev:

>**Unfortunately, we need to remove Ray Tracing and DLSS from the EA version.** The main reason is that our development resources cannot support multiple technical features, especially pure technical features, which means that this feature will not bring substantial improvements to gameplay. Therefore, we lowered the priority of this feature over the past year. After struggling for a long time, we finally decided to drop it from the launch version. This decision was not easy, as we are a team of technology-driven game developers, especially since we spent a lot of time doing ray tracing benchmarks for Boundary.",Nvidia
2568,16ap7hw,1693922725.0,Star Wars: Jedi Survivor new Patch 7 adds DLSS Support,,481,Electrical_Form_7572,"so its okay for CDPR to deprioritise FSR because its only 9% of market share (ignoring the fact that GTX cards also benefited from its addition), but we cannot image a world in which a developer or pulisher decides that DLSS isnt a priority when, from their point of view, not only does FSR address the entire PC market, but also the entire console market.

once again, to be crystal clear, i agree with you on this. CDPR probably thought FSR 1 was a good enough holdover while they focused on other shit. god knows CP2077 needed help.

my question is, why cant we extend this benefit of the doubt to these other games?

for star wars, the game launched in a messy state, when you're aproaching release 99% of studios are crunching hard to polish the game, they already have FSR for conoles, and that adresses the whole market. they have a small team spend a day adding DLSS, and then more time validating the work, or they could get hard at work optimising the game as much as possible, and push really hard for bugfixing before release, and following that the initial patches.

you could say much of the same for starfield, except that has an even bigger reason to neglect DLSS for now. Xbox bought bethesda, and they delayed starfield and entire year to polish it up on Xbox as much as possible. we know that the xbox consoles both utilise FSR to reach their 30fps target consistantly. the game still has some issues and bugs after a YEAR of straight polishing, why is it unreasonable that DLSS is on the backburner for now?

why does sony add DLSS then? because they dont launch their games to PC and PS5 at the same time. most of the time the game has already been out for years, its polished, its finished. they have all the time in the world to sort the game out for PC, the deadline is just alot less stressful.

doesnt all of this seem more likely, or at least as likely, as AMD paying then to specifically excluse DLSS?

can you even admit that there is a possibility that my story could be true?

im willing to admit that AMD could have payed for exlusivity. i just dont think we have the evidence to make a definitive statement...

just like you can construct a story about evil AMD being anti competitive, i can construct a story of game devs under tight schedules in the height of crunch just having prioritise that dont align with what you want at launch, with the exact same evidence that you have",Nvidia

Well yea, THAT would be anti-trust because they own like 80%+ of the market. Just the inclusion of ray-tracing already hurts AMD because their cards can't run it as well.

I agree it's a bad practice, but AMD doesn't have the competitive edge to make it a serious issue. IMO Nvidia locking implementation *within its own line* is a bigger concern since they're so big they are essentially competing with themselves. 

Now if they (AMD) start sending C&Ds to the modders implementing DLSS that could turn interesting

The Quadros we use, while they are comparatively louder at the same core/memory temp, they're not jet engine loud like people say they will be nor do they get unconventional hot. The undervolt and clock isn't significant either. You can undervolt and underclock, for example, an FE model, which is already known to have lower power ratings than AIB, and barely lose any performance while lowering temps. My home PC uses an FE and a blower style card (Gigabyte 3090 Turbo). When training models on both, the blower card finishes training around the same time as the FE. It *does* get louder but it's not that much louder, and that's only when the fan ramps up. It's usually quiet. Same with the Quadros in the lab - they're usually quiet.

The average user will be quite unhappy with a blower style card compared to a traditional axial fan card, but that's primarily due to noise. I was merely pointing out the differences and why someone would tend to avoid a blower card for gaming. They also need frequent maintenance, unless you have a very clean environment, good dust filters, and positive case pressure (which given the state of many of the rigs I see on here isn't a common occurrence), since you can't just blow them off without taking the heatsink apart to get access to the fins like you can on an axial fan card.

Most of the negatives that can be said about it are preferential, they also depend on many environmental factors like you said.

The easiest way to tell if you have a blower card is if everything is closed off and no heat sink is visible, this means you have a blower card as the heat’s only escape is through the ventilation and holes on the back of the graphics cards at the back of your pc.

Secondly, even though blower cards are known to get very hot, they will never blow or release heat into your case unlike a regular fan cooling system which blows almost zero out out the back of the graphics card, with the heat instead being released into the air inside your case as it is completely exposed instead of having a cover with only one exit for hot air like a blower card.",Nvidia

Regular fan cooled GPUs are usually the way to go, but even if you have a blower card, it’s nothing to be worried to about as most of the computers that use them require them especially prebuilts like Alienware with some of their prebuilts being very compact and tight together. The cooling difference between them aswell is not that incredibly bad and in my opinion, blower cards look cleaner and higher end compared to a regular fan cooled gpu.",Nvidia

Check out this review by TPU, they directly compare the Asus Dual to the FE in all benchmarks. Framerates are nearly identical. Dual is a bit quieter but weidly uses a bit more idle more power shows it could potentially need a better vcurve. It's a toss up imo you can't go wrong with either.

I got a 1080p freesync / g-sync compatible monitor. 
I don't have any gpu right now ( I offered mine to a friend who's gpu died). 
I'm thinking to get an rtx 3000 or 4000 gpu next month but I would like to know if I could use the adaptive sync as well as dsr or dldsr. 
I had at some point a gtx 1650 and the adaptive sync was working well but couldn't try dldsr with it and didn't think to try dsr (the gpu was struggling enough at native res). 

Anyone has an idea?

If you want to create an upscaler then replace the DLSS in games with your own upscaler, you can also do that, but it may require some reverse engineering.

In games with DLSS there is a file called `nvngx_dlss.dll`. This allows the game to interact with DLSS. You can replace this file with an interposer that connects the game to your project. However to do this you need to disable DLSS signing (a feature to stop people from using unofficial DLSS files) and create that interposer. You can see this mod for Cyberpunk 2077 as an example where they replaced DLSS with FSR via this method:

FSR3 comes with a HUGE caveat that everyone seems to be overlooking.

It comes in 2 versions, one that works on all gpus (including console) but has huge latency and is .... rather pointless to use ...

But the ""good"" version doesnt run on anything other than AMDs latest GPUs.

So ya'll think FSR3 will suddenly give all those old GPUs Frame Gen are in for a surprise, I guarantee that you will turn it off again after trying it. Even double FPS is not worth it with huge latency increase.

2 clicks is enabling DLSS in the game. That's integration, not QA/testing.

QA/testing is:  
\- Checking all locations and features in the game with DLSS on, making sure games doesn't crash and everything's working fine. If not, bug report is filled.  
\- When new location or feature is added, it needs to be checked with DLSS on

You are talking about integration again. Integration is not a problem. QA/testing is.  
If you have native and FSR, adding just DLSS means that testing workload increased by 33.3%. If you add both XeSS and DLSS, testing workload will increase by 50%. That's huge.  


Also, FSR is open source and Nvidia could have added their DLSS algorithms into it.

Another route is talking to Vulkan committee and Microsoft to have the single upscaler API in Vulkan and Direct 12. 

Did Nvidia do it? Also no.

3212,16a9dta,1693874419.0,RTX 4090 FE - my perspective and one problem,"Hello everyone,

recently I bought an RTX 4090 FE and as you may or may not have seen I asked (out of fear of doing something wrong) if my 4090 has the new connector and if my Corsair 12vhpwr connector is seated correctly. After setting everything up I turned my PC on and got into trying everything.

First off I'm coming from a GTX 1070 Ti blower style card which was very loud even at below 100% utilization. I also had an RX 6800 XT red devil but returned it due to terrible coil whine and some driver issues. I'm running a triple monitor setup - 2 27"" 1440p and one 34"" 1440p 21:9 monitor(s).

First I tried DLSS because I was curious if it really is superior to FSR and I can definitely say it is. It honestly amazes me how good it looks and performs while drawing less power (note: I power limited my 4090 to 70% without any meaningful performance loss).

The second feature I tried is DLDSR. This was the most exciting because I am an image quality freak. As long as I have 120 fps in multiplayer and 90 fps in single player games I am all about image quality. I tried 2.25 DLDSR on my 3440x1440 monitor which resulted in 5160x2160 resolution.

That said, you are discounting Display Stream Compression. DSC supports a roughly 3:1 compression losslessly.

This means you could probably run that monitor over Displayport at up to 180hz @ 8 Bit, 144hz @ 10 bit, or 120hz @ 12 bit (and likely a bit higher on each, I'm just using industry standard hz numbers to calculate rough bandwidth).

I do wonder how HDMI 2.1 works on this monitor however. The roughly 20% increase in bandwidth with DSC would likely let you hit 240hz @ 10 bit.",Nvidia

I have an MSI Z590 Ace.  It has 6 sensors:

* CPU Sensor - This one is not on the board it is reported to the motherboard by the CPU.  My Intel CPU reports a temp for each of it's 8 Core every quarter second.  The number reported is the hottest of the 8.  This sensor is the most important!  I have the 3 of my 6 case fans tied to this temp.  I want them to keep the CPU below it's threshold of damage.  The CPU Fan, the intake fan directly in front of the CPU Tower cooler and the exhaust fan directly behind the tower cooler are all controlled by this read out.  It is NOT the hottest of my sensors.
* PCH Sensor - This is the fan directly below the one blowing on the CPU cooling tower.  It blows directly across the PCM ( Z590 chip set) and into the GPU.  This one is usually the hottest.
* M.2 Sensor - This one is on the motherboard just above the GPU.  If the GPU is hot the air just above it will be hot.  This also tells me the temp of the M.2 running the operating system.
* MOS Sensor - The components on the motherboard that provide power to the CPU are called ""Metal Oxide Semiconductor Voltage Reference Modules"".  While I would abbreviate this VRM, MSI decided to call this MOS in the BIOS where it is controlled.  This section of the board is just above the CPU where I have mounted an exhaust fan blowing out of the top of the case.  I do not do overclocking so I do not expect this area to be hot but I use it to control the RPM on the case top exhaust fan

There are other sensors but I do not use them.  There is a thermistor provided that plugs into the motherboard and can be placed anywhere within the case.  I have it near the PSU to understand the temperatures below the PSU shroud but they are near room temp so no fans are controlled with this sensor.",Nvidia

I have a Suprim Liquid and it came with fans. Sure you can easily connect two 120mm fans to it and call it a day but if you paid anything close to MSRP or higher for a 4090, you should get a complete 4090.

Also, other than sourcing your own fans if you decide to stick with your purchase, just know you do need a specific length of screw to mount fans on the radiator. Another set of screws will also be needed to mount radiator to your case. Hopefully it came with both sets but if you're missing radiator fans, I highly doubt it.

Anecdotally I was playing fairly recent games in 2018, but now I'm still only up to playing games from 2020 at the latest. But I've also upgraded my monitor from 1440p60 to 4K144. Suddenly games from 2016 such as Deus Ex Mankind Divided run like complete garbage at 4K when at 1440p they were much more acceptable. Even though everyone would say the 1080 Ti was a future-proofed card and should be fine for years, my demands and requirements changed and suddenly it wasn't good enough for the targets I was pushing for (despite me playing relatively older games).

Your take is correct though that the 3060 is a bit of a weak card performance-wise and the 3060 Ti probably will be a bit VRAM limited if games decide to continue with the level of optimisation we've seen over this past year. I just don't think we can anticipate how long any card lasts after its generation. Software keeps changing, demands keep changing, it's too hard to know.",Nvidia

I had saved the budget even for a 4090, but went for a 4070 instead. My reasoning is

* I would not be making full use of it.
   * \+electricity which is an issue in my country (Greece).
* There is tech (pathtracing) that even 4090 cannot do without AI.
* 50-series is supposedly going to be insane.
* Since NVIDIA is adamant on fixing prices, I will probably be able to resell 4070 for a price between 400-460€. Considering I bought one of the best 4070-models for just 620€ after tax, I am essentially renting a gpu for \~200€ till the next gen arrives (1.5-2 years).

As many have said, think not of future-proofing. I just changed my GTX980 -> 4070 and that old pal lasted from 2014. This won't happen anymore. Make the best play according to your needs **now** and utilize the used market to either buy or sell.

Why you should get a 4090:

* You are absolutely going to make full use of it and/or need it.

In my opinion, you lost the best year of the card for winning something like 50€ off the price? I mean 4090 still sells in MSRP but some sells might occur. Therefore if you do not actually need it and at the same time need to upgrade, something like me, I would suggest going for something midrange but adequate because there is a big tech leap about to happen (as it seems) and I'd rather hop on the new series that will support it and not risk it on the current, albeit powerful, enthusiast option.",Nvidia

Should I hold off a few months to see if the rumours are true about the 'ti' variant being cancelled or just take a risk?,247,ElDudeBruv,"I saw your comment on not upgrading for a long time. Imo you have the wrong approach, specially for high end GPUs.

At 4090 level of pricing, the only reasonable approach is to upgrade each new gen because you are not a price sensitive consumer. If you hesitate because it's a lot of money, the smart move isn't to spend a lot of money once and forget it on a high end GPU. The smart move is to upgrade often on lower end GPUs. 

Buying a 4070 now and a 5070 then and repeating with the 6070 is better than only getting the 4090 for 3 generations. You get more money back from selling your GPUs and you end up with better experience through the years because a 6070 is going to stomp the 4090.

That's my two cents. Especially since upgrading a GPU is the easiest, fastest and most painless upgrade for gaming. CPU you have to deal with a bunch of other parts and the process is more involved.

Edit: Also, 7900xt from looking at recent benchmarks is so much better value. That's what I would get right now if I was shopping. Idk what you have right now, so it's hard to recommend, maybe you already have a decent GPU. I got a 3080 and I'm itching for an upgrade, but imo it's just not worth it. I was debating a 4090, but it's too much money for just gaming.",Nvidia

But I wonder if the bottleneck of the 4090 is its L2 Cache & Memory Bandwidth, cause it has around 68% more CUDA Cores than the 4080 but is ""only"" 30% to 40% more powerful so there's a lot of performance left on the table...

A 4090ti could come out next year, depending on what AMD’s 8000 series gpus look like, but as someone who has to have the latest and greatest, even I don’t feel like I even remotely need or want a ti version of the 4090.

One last thing: Probably the SINGLE biggest thing I like about the 4090 is how consistently high the 1% lows are across all my games.

The heat of the card when gaming doesn't have anything to do with the heat generated.  

Heat generation is directly proportional to power used.  I use to have a 1080 TI that used 300W+ overclocked and it space-heated my room.  A 290x which was a value champ over 5 years ago used 290W and also space-heated my room.

The good thing about a 4090 is you can really undervolt it to get it under 300W and only lose 10-15% performance.  The whole 4000 series undervolts very well since Nvidia now pre-overclocks all their cards which puts them on a very inefficient part of their performance-to-power curve.",Nvidia

I have a 5800x3D and a 4090 and I’ve almost never noticed any artifacting with Frame Gen at 3440x1440 (freesync premium pro OLED monitor, vsync enabled in NVCP).

I’ve tested 8 games with Frame Gen and the only time I noticed artifacts were when Spider-Man Remastered first launch but they were fixed with updates 

In this game, and using PureDark’s similar mod for Jedi Survivor, no visual blemishes. I’m very susceptible to these kinds of things, I look for them.

I know this isn’t helpful. I don’t know why they rarely ever manifest with frame generation on for me. I don’t have an answer, especially if they are still there when you uncap the framerate. 75 is definitely low for framegen tho

They must have figured the game is good and big enough to survive said discontent and it would sell in droves anyway so might as well take the extra money. As a consumer I don't like it but it's a financial decision that made sense for them.

Cool...? Let me introduce you to script extenders that have existed for just about all Bethesda games and countless other ways people have done all these things.

PureDark isn't selling a video game cloned from Starfield by reverse engineering its code, either. PureDark's mod is not even replacing any files, it's all extra stuff.

>performing in-game services in exchange for payment outside the Game

Doesn't apply here. Starfield in particular is not an online game and PureDark doesn't spawn in your server to do something for you. It's a pretty obvious anti-RMT rule for online components (even if the game doesn't have online components at this time).",Nvidia

Fast-paced games with lots of moving stuff (FPS games in particular) prefers high frame rates over more pixels. More immersive games are going to benefit a ton from the extra pixels, even if you upscale. G-sync is particularly strong at providing fluidity, and going from a fixed refresh rate to it is really going to change stuff.

With 1080p the view distance is much larger when it comes to seeing pixels so the downscale in quality is very noticeable.

DLSS mod really makes all the difference on Nvidia graphic cards. 

I'm also not sure why they got such low numbers, GN got 43 FPS on 3060 Ti with high settings and no upscaling, so 42 at medium on 3070 sounds really low. DLSS practically doubles the frame rate without any noticeable loss of quality on top of that, so 60+ on high shouldn't be an issue (ultra might be I guess, depending on the CPU).

My setup is 7600x with 4060 Ti, with DLSS mod from the link and 67% upscaling. Again, I don't know the exact FPS I'm getting, but I haven't noticed any stuttering or artefacts, so my experience was overall great.

Can't say if you will get the same from 3070 or an older processor, perhaps DLSS 2 is significantly worse, but you should still get a very good experience overall with a mix of medium and high settings and quality upscaling.

Even performance upscaling still works pretty well. Though at 50% you might start getting some artifacts when moving the camera quickly, but I haven't noticed any of that so far at my settings.

In the end, it's a trade-off, but the game doesn't feel particularly poorly optimised to me, compared to some other titles which run terribly on anything with less than 12 GB of VRAM.",Nvidia
