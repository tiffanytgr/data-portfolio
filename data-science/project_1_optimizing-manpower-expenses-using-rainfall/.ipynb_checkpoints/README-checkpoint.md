# Optimizing Manpower Allocation for STB

# Introduction

Singapore Tourism Board (STB) faces a significant increase in operating expenses, leading to a growing deficit. To avoid potential attraction closures, STB aims to reduce manpower costs, particularly at the Singapore Zoo and Science Center. The objective is to explore the correlation between weather conditions (rainfall, humidity, temperature) and visitor numbers, enabling smarter manpower decisions. By adjusting staff on shift based on visitor count, STB seeks to optimize expenses without compromising customer service quality.

# Data Cleaning / Processing
- No null values so no rows were dropped
- Filtered data to only 2010 to 2019 due to Covid
- Filtered data to exclude school holiday months (June and December) as number of visitors is always higher due to population's availability
